# numberMethods2

  In that project I immpllemented 4 methods for solving Systems of linear algebraic equations.
  In Methos_functions you can find classes with 1)2 accurate methods; 2)2 iterational methods; 3)useful mathematical functions.
  In package "Data for tests" text data for testind is placed. System of equasions in matrix form (left and right parts) and solution in last line. Although, test_6 is 
kinda specific. Matrix for it can be created by implemented functions, so file consist of answers onle (1 line = 1 answer) (For further understanding see "samples_for_main")
  Then you can see package "Print samples for main". There are diferent parts of code placed. You can paste these parts into main method to see result of executing
implemented methods with tests from "data for tests".
  To check accurate methods, try "first_five_tests_accurate" and "sixth_test_accurate".
